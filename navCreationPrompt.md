üßæ Final Detailed Prompt for Bootstrap Navigation Bar (with dropdown & right-aligned menu)

Prompt:

Create a responsive navigation bar (navbar) using Bootstrap 5.
The navbar should be inside a container for proper alignment and spacing.

Layout Requirements:

The company logo or site name should appear on the left side of the navbar.

The navigation links should appear on the right end of the navbar (use ms-auto or appropriate Bootstrap utility class for alignment).

The navigation links should include:

The navbar should collapse into a hamburger menu on smaller screens (Bootstrap‚Äôs responsive collapse feature).

The dropdown should work properly on both desktop and mobile.

Design & Styling Requirements:

Use Bootstrap 5.3 CDN for CSS and JS.

The navbar background should be light (e.g., bg-light) or customizable via CSS.

The text color should be dark (text-dark) for contrast.

On smaller devices, the menu items should collapse neatly under the toggle button.

The dropdown should have hover or click support (Bootstrap default behavior is click on mobile, hover on desktop).

Add subtle hover effects to nav links (like a slight color change or underline).

The active link (e.g., ‚ÄúHome‚Äù) should be visibly highlighted.

Technical Details:

Include all HTML code inside a <nav> tag wrapped in a container for centering.

Use navbar-expand-lg to make the navbar expand on large screens.

Use Bootstrap‚Äôs built-in collapse toggle button (the hamburger icon).

Ensure the navbar remains fully responsive on all screen sizes.

Provide complete HTML code from <!DOCTYPE html> to </html>.

Include a small custom <style> block to fine-tune spacing, hover effects, and brand text size if needed.

Optional Enhancements (add if desired):

Make the navbar sticky at the top (sticky-top) so it stays visible when scrolling.

Add a slight box-shadow or border-bottom for a cleaner header look.

Include a colored version (e.g., dark background with white text) as an alternate variant.

The final output should be a clean, centered, responsive Bootstrap navigation bar with:

Left-aligned logo or brand name

Right-aligned menu with dropdown

Fully functional collapse on mobile

Simple, elegant design that fits seamlessly with a hero slider section
