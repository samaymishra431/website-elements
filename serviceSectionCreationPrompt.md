Create a modern, fully responsive Services Section using Bootstrap 5.

Section Layout & Content:

Section Heading:

Centered main heading: “Our Services”

Subtitle/paragraph below heading: ~40 words describing the services in a concise, professional tone.

Services Grid:

6 service boxes in total:

3 boxes per row → 2 rows

Each service box should include:

An icon (Bootstrap icons or font-awesome) at the top

Service Heading (e.g., Service 1, Service 2, Service 3…)

Two-line descriptive paragraph below the heading

A “Read More” button at the bottom

Visual Design & Styling:

Boxes should have subtle shadows and rounded corners

Icon, heading, and text should be visually aligned and spaced properly

Button should have a hover effect (e.g., color change or slight elevation)

Make the section mobile-friendly and responsive, stacking boxes vertically on smaller screens

Optional Enhancements:

Hover effect for each service box (slight lift or background overlay)

Background color or gradient for the section to differentiate it from other sections

Technical Notes:

Use Bootstrap 5 classes for layout and responsiveness

Ensure proper padding/margins so the section looks clean on all screen sizes

Provide complete HTML + CSS code with icons included
