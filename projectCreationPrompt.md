üßæ Final Detailed Prompt for Projects Section (Plain Language Version)

Prompt:

Create a modern, visually appealing ‚ÄúProjects‚Äù section for a website.

Layout Requirements:

The section should have a main heading like ‚ÄúOur Projects‚Äù and a short description below it, centered.

Include tabs at the top so visitors can filter projects by category, for example: All, App, Product Branding, Books.

Display the projects in a neat grid layout. On larger screens show three projects per row, fewer on smaller screens.

Each project card should have:

A background image

Project title

Short description

A button or link like ‚ÄúView Project‚Äù

Optionally, make some middle cards slightly higher than the others for a staggered effect.

Design & Styling:

Cards should have a subtle dark overlay so text is easy to read.

Text (title, description, button) should be centered on each card.

When someone hovers over a card, it should slightly grow bigger.

Buttons should change color when hovered over.

Tabs should clearly show which category is active.

The section background should be light, clean, and visually consistent.

Additional Features:

Make sure everything looks good on both desktop and mobile.

Include smooth hover effects for the cards and buttons.

Each project should feel distinct and engaging.

Final Output Should Include:

Main heading and description

Tabs to filter projects

Grid of project cards with background images and overlay text

Hover effects and interactive buttons

Clean and modern design, fully responsive
